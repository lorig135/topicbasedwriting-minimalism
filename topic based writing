Per our company-wide direction to make our products easier to use, especially for the needs of our newer customers, 
we're moving toward topic-based writing, minimalism, and chunking. This is not a huge undertaking; it just requires
a shift in focus from writing about the topic to writing about the topic within the framework of the user's needs.

# Topic-Based Writing
Keep the following in mind:
Who is the audience?
What do they need to do or learn?
How do our products help them do something or learn something? 
What natural language would they use to search for information about our products? 

Topic-based writing is comprised of three elements: Concepts, Tasks, and References. 

## Concepts
Concepts explain what something is, such as an element of our products or how it works (the Admin UI, how IGA manages and reduces user risk). One noteworthy model for writing about concepts is Wikipedia. 

### Writing About Concepts
Title: Use the imperative: Set Up Access Management, Upgrade from 6.5 to 7.0
Paragraph: 2-3 sentences (or however many are needed) for the user to understand the concept. Use a collapse for information
that is important, but not critical.

## Tasks
Steps or actions taken to accomplish a goal or task, usually in a numbered list. 
Ex. Installing the CDM on a cluster, Authenticating using 2FA
Model: Cookbooks

### Writing About Tasks
Title: Use the imperative: Set Up Access Management, Upgrade from 6.5 to 7.0
Paragraph: 2-3 sentences (or however many are needed) for the user to understand the concept. Use a collapse for information
that is important, but not critical.

Numbered steps: Each sentence or sentence fragment should be a sequential step that helps the user complete a task. 

You can also use graphics or video snippets to explain the sequence of steps to complete a task.
